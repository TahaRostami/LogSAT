"""
This script demonstrates a basic adaptation of parallel/distributed SAT solving.

The core idea is to divide the search space into non-overlapping subspaces and solve each in parallel.

We adopt the Cube-and-Conquer approach [1], where the original SAT formula is partitioned into smaller sub-problems 
called cubes. Each cube represents a partial assignment (a conjunction of literals) that constrains the solution space.

Workflow:
1. Use a look-ahead solver (e.g., `march_cu`) to partition the formula into cubes.
2. For each cube, spawn a parallel SAT solver process with the cube added as unit clauses.
3. If any solver returns SAT, terminate the rest and return the satisfying assignment.
4. If all solvers return UNSAT, then the original formula is UNSAT.

Additional Notes:
- This prototype is written in Python for clarity. In practice, shell scripts and more optimized infrastructure are 
    often preferred.
- For simplicity, we omit detailed logging, cube/formula serialization, or runtime statistics, though these can be 
    easily integrated.
- In safety-critical or formally verified applications, results are often checked by an additional verification phase.
- Although this script runs everything on a single multi-core machine, the same principles extend naturally to 
    distributed or cloud-based environments for large-scale SAT instances.
